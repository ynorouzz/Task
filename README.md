# Case

Our fictional e-commerce company wants better insight into the sales of products, and the data team is therefore asked to develop an API on which to ask how often a certain product has been sold in the past days.

# Data format
Every day the department will receive a file with the sales of the previous day. The file is a json dump, each line contains a transaction:

{"Id": customer id, "products": list of product_ids associated with the transactions}

Attached the transactions of 7th of February.

 # Requirements

- create a publicly accessible git repository

- do in between commits so that the steps that have been taken can be derived from your commits

- keep an eye on scaling and performance.

- use Python 3

- make use of the best practices

- give comments in your code to explain why you make certain choices. For this test, too many comments do not exist as long as they clarify what your thinking is

- document the assumptions you make.

- (EXTRA) - add authorization
